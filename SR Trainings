CDS Views: 
- Core data services
- A view which we will creata a DB layer and in this we can perform all slicing of data and even we can also perform aggregations/ all conditional operator and what ever you want 
  you can perform on CDS views.
- Here entire code pusing to the Data base and not in the application layer

What is Hana public cloud/private cloud/ on-premise?
______________________________________________________
Public clound:
-SAP is the cloud provider and Manage the software and software updated are controlled by SAP time lines.
-Many applications like ARiba/Hybris/Successfactors are public cloud.

HANA Private/Managed Cloud– SAP as a cloud provider manages the software with managed services approach. It is a private cloud that enables customers to run core application on cloud on HANA platform.

HANA On-Premise–  This option where software is installed and run by the customer as S4 HANA offers this option.

From a technical point of view, to check which option is activated in the system, these are controlled by few  business functions.

Business Functions: SIMPLIFY_PUBLIC_CLOUD, SIMPLIFY_MANAGED_CLOUD,  SIMPLIFY_ON_PREMISE

What is ABAP CDS?
__________________
- ABAP CDS provides a framework for defining and consuming semantic data models on the DB of the ABAP AS. The data models are based on data definition language[DDL] and data control language[DCL]. 

What are ABAP CDS Entities?
____________________________
ABAP CDS entities are models, based on the DDL and are managed by ABAP Dictonary.
CDS Entities are :
1. CDS View
2. ABAP CDS Table Function

What is ABAP CDS View?
________________________
- A CDS View is defined on the existing DB tables/Views/Other CDS Views in ABAP Dictionary using specific DDL statements-DEFINE VIEW.
- It serves to define the structure of the CDS Database View and represents a project on several DB tables and Views in abap dictionary.
- A CDS view associated with the CDS Data Base View and CDS entity and both are part of same name space. so, different name must be assigned to the database view and to the cds entity.

When a CDS view activated it creates the following objects 
1. Actual CDS entity.
2. CDS Database view.

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName:'SQL_VIEW' -->Name of the CDS database view.
DEFINE VIEW <<entity_name>> as select from 
  |_ here <<entity_name>> -->Name of the CDS entity


What is CDS table function?
_____________________________
- These are table functions that are implemented natively on the data base and this is called in CDS View.
- Table function supports code push down capablities in ABAP CDS.
- A CDS Table Function is defined using statement DEFINE TABLE FUNCTION . In contrast to the CDS views , 
  the CDS table functions can be implemented by using native SQL . The implementation is done within AMDP method of the AMDP class and is managed as an AMDP function by the AMDP framework in the DB.

Ex:
DEFINE TABLE FUNCTION TABLE_FUNCTION_NAME1
WITH PARAMETERS carrid : s_Carrid....
returns{ ..... } implemented by method CL_EXAMPLE_AMDP=>GET_FLIGHTS;

CLASS CL_EXAMPLE_AMDP DEFINITION PUBLIC.
 public section.
   interfaces : IF_AMDP_MARKER_HDB.
   class-methods: get_flights for table function TABLE_FUNCTION_NAME1.
  ...................
  ...................
ENDCLASS>

CLASS CL_EXAMPLE_AMDP IMPLEMENTATION.
  methods get_flights by database function for HDB....
      ....
      ....
  endmethod.
ENDCLASS.
ENDCLASS.


ABAP CDS View Class-1
When we create the CDS views, SAP has offered two types of Views.
1. DDL sql View : A view which will be created in SE11 or applcation layer abap.
2. CDS entity: A view which is created into the DB layer.

in SAP HANA, its an open sourcei.e we can change the standard program. but in ECC, it will ask for an access key, where as in s4 it an open source it won't ask any access key .
but we need to follow the SAP standards only.

CDS Views:
______________
pushing the entire to the DB layer and get the resultant value.

we have different types of cds views:
1. define view: --> view which is created on a single table, where we will slice the data.
2. View with joins: A view which is created on morethan one table
    using inner join/ lefter outer/ right outer/ union/ union all.
3. View with parameters: if i want an input parameter based on input values i need to provide the o/p also.
4. View with association: associations are similar to the joins but it is lazy join whenever we are getting the field from that particular table.
Ex: for A With B, Association on B, when we are getting the values from B table then only the join will work.
Compares to the joins, Associations are very fast.
suppose if you are associated with 20 tables, but you have used the few fields from 5 associations only in selection list so those are will join remaining associations tables
will work with lazy join.
5. CDS View extension: extends the standard cds view to accomdate with the custom fields.
   1. CFL--> Custom Fields Applogic--> this is directly in FIORI APP.
   2. Extended CDS View: 

How to use the CDS View and How can we convert this CDS view into a OData Service.? --> Directly generating and URL for this CDS view.
______________________________________________________________________________________

6. VDE- Virtual Data Elements:
    I want to call the FM inside the CDS View
7. VDM- Virtual Data Models --> which we will used for FIORI Apps. but this we have used till SAP HANA 1809, from SAP HANA1909 SAP has introduced new a fiori app called as 
    custom analytical query

Note: Previously we will use the CDS View only for fetch the data from SAP system, with the advance technology like RAP and SAP BTP we can able to post the data into SAP system.
      in RAP, CDS will convert into a root entity on this we will create a behaviour definition and behaviour implementation on this SAP will provide the CRUD operation to update/read data to SAP/From SAP.

Annotations: are nothing but library components.
- Libraries are nothing but what action performed on CDS View, using annotations only we can define the purpose of the cds view.


Class-2:

Create CDS View:

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZSQLView_Table' // SE11- view
@EndUserText.label: 'First CDS View'
define view zvcdsview_with_one_table as select from vbak
{
vbeln,
ernam,
erdat,
vkorg,
vtweg,
spart
}

save and activate.. it will activate it with warning.
Warning: Key field missing in selection list.
key definitions of zvcdsview_with_one_Table and vbak are different, VBELN is missing in key of  zvcdsview_with_one_Table.

shift + F1 --> pretty printer.

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZSQLView_Table' // SE11- view
@EndUserText.label: 'First CDS View'
define view zvcdsview_with_one_table as select from vbak
{
key vbeln ,
ernam,
erdat,
vkorg,
vtweg,
spart
}

save and activate.. now you will not get any warnings..

F8--> display the data in preview.

Now cross check sql view created or not in Se11.
Sql view name:ZSQLView_Table: --> go to se11 --> select view radio button --> provide sql name:ZSQLView_Table and display. here it is name as CDS Database view/DDL SQL View also.

Question:
in which table i can find the relation ship between the cds entity and CDS database view?- DDLDEPENDENCY
-  Search with CDS entity in DDL source( zvcdsview_with_one_table ) in DDLDEPENDENCY, it will display 2 objects-VIEW object- DDL SQL VIEW and STOB( Structured Object)

Operations in CDS view:
_______________________
1. Concatenate
2. Triming
3. Adding numbers
4. conditional( cond) opertor
5. Casting operator
6. Currency conversion operator
7. Data conversion


Session Variables:
___________________
In classical ABAP, sy-uname, sy-datum--- those are not work in CDS View, in lace of that we will use the session variables
in CDS View, whenever we want to use any session variables $session.<system vraibales?
1. $session.client --> current system client
2. $session.system_Date --> current date
3. $session.system_language --> logon language
4. $session.user --> Logged on user
5. $session.user_DAte -->
6. $session.user_timezone -->

Ex: 

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZSQLView_Table' // SE11- view
@EndUserText.label: 'First CDS View'
define view zvcdsview_with_one_table as select from vbak
{
key vbeln ,
ernam,
erdat,
vkorg,
vtweg,
spart,
$session.user as user,
$session.system_Date as date 
}

Output
__________
vbeln  -----  ERNAM ---- ERDAT      ---- VKORG ---- VTWEG ---- SPART ---- USER ---- DATE
00001  -----  SATIS ---- 2022-01-23 ---- 1000   ---- 01    ---- 01 ---- SATHISH ---- 2025-06-25


End user text Provide:
____________________________
Whenever we are exposing the CDS View to outside the system/fiori app, we need to provide meaningful description required for desired fieds in CDS VIEW
-For this we need to use the annotation called endusertext.
-Anotation : @EndUserText.label : '<fields description> -->fieldcatalog-seltext_m/s/l
             @EndUserText.quickInfo : '<<provide descirption>'

Ex: @EndUserText { label : 'Executed User'
                   quickInfo : 'Executed User' }
 or for Individual
@EndUserText.label : 'Executed User'
@EndUserText.quickInfo : 'Executed User'

Ex: with CDS View.
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZSQLView_Table' // SE11- view
@EndUserText.label: 'First CDS View'
define view zvcdsview_with_one_table as select from vbak
{
key vbeln ,
ernam,
@EndUserText { label : 'Executed User'
                   quickInfo : 'Executed User' }
$session.user as user,

@EndUserText.label : 'Current Date'
@EndUserText.quickInfo : 'Current Date'
$session.system_Date as date 
}
ACTIVATE + F8( execute )
When you activate this and we can't able to see this description in the eclipse outline and output also.
output will show in the form of field names or aliases.
in SQL View also we can't able to see the description for date/user- only alias name will appears

@EndUserText -- only visible in FIORi apps.


String Operations:
_____________________
Concatenate:  23:00
______________
In CDS View by default we can able to concatenate two fields at a time.
- concatenate- concatenate the arguments without space- 
- concat(arg1, arg2).
- if i need to concatenate morethan 2 fields , so i need to concatenate morethan one time .
- in CDS View we need to use a keyword for concatenate is 'CONCAT'.
https://youtu.be/5gqlD2D9FLw?list=PLnVjDuttPTAZyF3YrHfIV0UoOz_tLZ3DM&t=1446 

req: My requirement is to concatenate vkorg/vtweg/spart 

@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZSQLView_Table' // SE11- view
@EndUserText.label: 'First CDS View'
define view zvcdsview_with_one_table as select from vbak
{
key vbeln ,
vkorg,
vtweg,
spart
ernam,
@EndUserText { label : 'Executed User'
                   quickInfo : 'Executed User' }
$session.user as user,

@EndUserText.label : 'Current Date'
@EndUserText.quickInfo : 'Current Date'
$session.system_Date as date ,

@EndUserText.label : 'sales area'
@EndUserText.quickInfo : 'sales area'
concat(vkorg, concat(vtweg, spart)) as sales_Area
}
activate and run- f8

output for sales area.
vkorg - - vtweg - - spart - - sales_Area
SGSS  - - SG    - - SG    - - SGSSSGSG

Concatenate With Space:
_______________________
- I want to concatenate with spaces use the keyword as concat_with_space.
-syntax: concat_with_space( arg1, arg2, space_cnt )
- here space_cnt- number of spaces are required between the arg1 and arg2.
- it is similar as concate.
- it is also accepts two parameters.

Ex: concate_with_space(vkorg, concate_with_space(vtweg,spart,1), 1) as sales_Area_space

sales_Area_space
