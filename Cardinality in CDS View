CDS VIEW Cardinality-zapyard:
_____________________
1. Cardinality relation ship between the source and association of the target tables/ cds views/ table functions/ SQL Views
   annd included in the defintions of the associations.
2. Association cardinality defines [min..max].
3. cardinality applies only to the target table/target view /target sql.
4. minimum and maximum only applicable to the target only not for the source.

cardinality ------------reacords association target
cardinality ------------ minmum-------------maximum
[1]         ------------    0  -------------   1                    - number of entries in target can be 0 or 1
[0..1]      ------------    0  -------------   1                    - number of entries in target can be 0 or 1
[1..1]      ------------    1  -------------   1                    - number of entries in target can be 1 or 1( only one record )
[0..*]      ------------    0  -------------   unlimited            - number of entries in target can be 0 or many
[1..*]      ------------    1  -------------   unlimited            - number of entries in target can be 1 or many (atleast one record)
not specified ----------    0  -------------   1 ( defualt logic)   - number of entries in target can be 0 or 1


mainly used for semantic of the data model, cardinality can't be validate. if you mention wongly we will get the syntax check warning.
cardinality is the optional--> if you not provide system will treat as default means 0..1 (0 is to 1 )
minimum can't be use with the star and maximum can't be the zero. means[*..0] - can't accept.

Associations:

1. What are Associations?
2. What is the difference between the Associations and Joins?
3. Why is Associations called Join on demand or lazy join?
4. cardinality in Associations?
5. Types of Assocations- Exposed and Ad-hoc?
6. How to use the CDS Associations in ABAP code?

What is Assocaitions in CDS?
_______________________________
- it is relationship between the Data model entoties. and it is not just data join. It is a relationship/conceptual wise.
- SAP recommends to use the Associations instead of joins because they are closure to conceptual thinking.
-  JOIN Vs Assocaiations: 
      - Both are working on SQL join only... 
     - Join is tight coupling( required or not.. it will join the both tables )
     - Association - loose coupling- when ever required only join will happen.. on demand will work.
     - in Association, actual join is created when the association is used in a path expression( called / triggered ).
     - Association will define using the "association" keyword.
     - Start the Association name with _<association name> that is different from stadard fields in CDS View.
      Ex: _salesItems
          _poItems

   Ex: 
   define view ZI_SALESORDER
   as select from vbak association [0..*] to ZI_salesItem as _Item
   on $project.SalesOrder = _Item.SalesOrder 
   {
   key f1,f2, _item     --> called as Exposed Associations
   }
  or
   
   {
   key f1, key _item.f2 ... --> called as Ad-hoc Associations 
   }
here $projection- means- selected fields in the view ZI_SALESORDER.

Types of Associations in CDS?
______________________________
2 types:
1. AD-HOC Associations ( if association fields are used in the view elements called adhoc associations )- tight coupling
AD-HOC Assocaitaions: - always join will happen when execute the CDS views.
Ex: 
define view ZMM_1_MAT as 
select from mara as m
association to marc as _plant 
on m.mara = _plant.mara
{
key matnr,
key _plant.werks,
_plant.mmsta
}
2. Exposed Associations - Expose total assocaitaion with out using any fields in view elemetns.- loose coupling( Join is the demand )

Ex: 
define view ZMM_1_MAT as 
select from mara as m
association to marc as _plant 
on m.mara = _plant.mara
{
key matnr,
_plant
}
once display the basic list --> roght click any row and select the "FOLLOW Association" --> able to display the detail list.
How to use/consume the Associations in ABAP code?
_________________________________________________
in ABAP use the \_<association name>-<field name> in field selection in select query.
\_<association1>\_<association2>-fieldname in the same cds view. here association-2 available in Association1
Ex
select lifnr, name,\_ZPOHead-ebeln, \_ZPOHead\_ZPOItem-ebelp
from ZSY_PO_VENDOR <-- cds view name
into table @data(itab).


Two level drill down Association:
___________________________________
Ex:
View1:
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName:'ZSYPURCHASS'
@EndUserText.label:'Po with Items'
define view zsy_purchase_Assoc
as select from ekko
association [1..*] to ekpo as _Item on ekko.ebeln = _item.ebeln
{
key ebeln,
ekorg,
lifnr,
_item
}

View2:
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName:'ZSYPURCHASS'
@EndUserText.label:'Po with Items'
define view zsy_purchase_Assoc
as select from lfa1
association [1..*] to zsy_purchase_Assoc as _zpohead on lfa1.lifnr = _zpohead.lfnr
{
key lifnr,
name1,
land1
_zpohead

}
Output:
basic list --> lifnr data
                  |_1 st drill down po header for corresponding vendors.
                           |_ 2nd drill down is line items for corresponding po nos.
