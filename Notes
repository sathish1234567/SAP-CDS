in CDS Disadvantage:
1.
-- OrderBY is not possible in CDS View
    -- to over come this we will go with TABLE FUNCTIONS. <-- order by achieveing...


2. @DefaultAggregation: #<SUM/MAX/MIN/..>
--  in normal CDS View it is not work then we can use it sum(<col>)... then it will work. <-- this will take care about SADL
--  in Analytical Query, @DefaultAggregation will work. <-- taken care by ANALYTICAL ENGINE
