Simplified Tables in FICO- S4HANA

1. Universal Jounal is the financial data, which are simplified in S4HANA using simplified tables.
- No change in master table majorly.
- most of the transactional tables are replaced with the ACDOCA table.
- in first version -simplefinance- ACDOCA table has introduced.
- ACDOCA table called in FInance- Universal Journal table
- SAP ACDOCA combines multiple traditional tables into a simple unified table -ACDOCA such as
  INDEX table: BSIS, BSAS, BSID, BSAD, BSIK, BSAK, COEP, ANEA, ANLP, FAGLFLE, MLIT ETC.
  (related receivable/payable/gl tables are there)
  BSIS- GL Open items
  BSAS- GL cleared Items

  BSID- Customer Open Items
  BSAD- Customer cleared Items

  BSIK- Vendor Open items
  BSAK- Vendor Cleared items.

  COEP- Cost related

  Asset line items tables:
  ANEA-
  ANEP-


Total table like :
FAGLFLEXT, COSP, COSS.

in simple finance/s4 hana-> any record will fetch related finance- system will get it ACDOCA table only

in Real time process: The ACDOCA table financial reporting becomes faster and more efficient.
it enables real-time analysis of financial data between 
1.  FI-Asset Accounting 
2.  General Ledger
3.  Material Ledger

No dependancy on batch processing.

FI- tables:
_______________
ACDOCA/ADDOCP/ACDOCU
ACDOCA- Universal Journal Entry Line Items table - BSEG also can be replaced with ACDOCA table
ACDOCP- Plan Line items -->When we planning in any other module in the plans like there are possibility like we are doing planning from cloud analytical or some other tools.
it will come to the SAP- ACDOCP table
ACDOCU- this is the consolidation table.

SAP S/4 HANA(Simple Finance):
____________________________________
SAP Released SAP S/4 in 2015 named as ‘Smart Finance’ and later it changed the name to ‘Simple Finance(S-FIN)’ and thereafter it was renamed as ‘S/4 HANA Finance’. 
S/4 HANA Finance provides a database table “ACDOCA”(Universal Journal) is which contains all the documents types from FI, CO, MM, SD, PP applications. 
All the postings to these applications are written in single ACDOCA table (so it’s a replacement table for existing traditional tables like BKPF,BSEG etc). 
This way system avoids data redundancy to a great extent.

What if we still need to access traditional tables? The traditional tables from system are replaced by HANA CDS(Core Data Services) views, which will be referencing and fetching data from ACDOCA(Universal Journal table). 
In this way SAP has ensured that the traditional tables are converted to database views so the existing programs using those as tables will not be impacted even after migration to S/4 HANA S-FIN. 
There still might be a minimal need to align and re-adjust some ABAP syntaxes which can be easily analyzed by doing syntax checks.

It will be user’s choice to either use ACDOCA or use CDS views to build reports/programs going forward after the migration. 
In my next blog I will try to explain practical use cases for ACDOCA table vs CDS views, so stay tuned!

Obsolete Tables and Compatibility Views:
_________________________________________
The data model in SAP S/4HANA has changed significantly, and the index and totals tables are obsolete. 
These tables have been replaced by compatibility views to make sure that older custom programs will continue to work. Technically, 
these tables are called core data services (CDS) views. 

Obsolete Table-----  DDL Source
BSAD          -----  BSAD_DDL
BSAK          -----  BSAK_DDL
BSAS          -----  BSAS_DDL
BSID          -----  BSID_DDL
BSIK          -----  BSIK_DDL
BSIS          -----  BSIS_DDL
This table lists obsolete finance tables and their corresponding compatibility and data definition language (DDL) sources.



ACDOCA: The Universal Journal
MATDOC Inventory Management:
_________________________________
SAP S/4HANA introduces MATDOC, a new inventory management system that eliminates over 26 tables present in SAP ECC. 
Now, material documents are stored in MATDOC instead of MKPF or MSEG tables. 
This removes redundancy and improves stock reporting efficiency.

Let us understand the differences by looking at the table structures:

VBUK and VBUP are still present in S/4 HANA but they are not filled when an order is created.
The status fields have been added through append structure.
Table Name	Description	        Append Name
VBAK	      Sales Order Header	VBAK_STATUS
VBAP	      Sales Order Item	  VBAP_STATUS
LIKP	      Delivery Header	    LIKP_STATUS
LIPS	      Delivery Item	      LIPS_STATUS
VBRK	      Billing Document Header	VBRK_STATUS

If any custom fields have been added to VBUP or VBUP tables in source system, they will have to be added to respective document tables in S/4 HANA system.
An append field to the document header status table VBUK must be added to one or several of the document header tables VBAK, LIKP, or VBRK. This decision depends on which of the document types the respective field is relevant for.
An append field to document item status table VBUP must be added to one or more of the document item tables VBAP or LIPS.

From Simplification list : Elimination of status tables VBUK, VBUP: Status fields have been moved to the corresponding header and item tables - VBAK and VBAP for sales documents, LIKP and LIPS for deliveries, VBRK for billing documents.
